# Gigstarter

When creating a new feature, make a branch out of develop and name it after that feature. Merge it into develop once the feature is working, the code is clean and you're done working on it.

Commit often, once for each atomic change you make. 

Commit messages should be short and descriptive, such as "Fixed the user get endpoint not working." or "Added functionality to create a user."

Do not write commit messages that does not specify what you changed, such as "Fixed some bugs." or "Added more stuff."

These guidelines will help us work better together, and if errors occur it will be easier to rollback.
